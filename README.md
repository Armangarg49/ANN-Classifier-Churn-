Access this project over here !!

It is a project that has been built to predict the probability that a user will end up churning or not. It is an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) classifier model that trains on about 80% of the data that is present in the dataset whilst about 20% data ends up in the testing.
I've used various libraries of python to successfully build this project, for example, tensorflow, numpy, pandas, sckit-learn etc.
